      <li>Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.</li>
      <li>Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just <code>console.log()</code> the information.</li>
      <li>Write the functions that <em>process</em> the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.</li>
      <li>Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just <code>console.log()</code> it).</li>
      <li>Display the information on your webpage!</li>
      <li>Add any styling you like!</li>
      <li>Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.</li>
      <li>Push that baby to github and share your solution below!</li>
    </ol>
